attach a drive number/idx to a system device id

FatFS uses drive numbers like 0:/, 1:/, 2:/.. etc
this allows attaching a system device id to a drive number
if you want to probe for FAT/ExFAT FS on the drive, use 'now'
e.g. fflib_attach (0, 0x010300000000000AULL, 1);
this will assign drive 0 to system device 0x010300000000000AULL and probe for FAT/ExFAT
the assignment will remain even if a FAT/ExFAT FS is not found, use fflib_detach to de-assign
